# Lending Club Case Study
To identify the risky loan applicants at the time of loan application so that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss..

## Abstract - 

1. Lending club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans,business loans, and financing of medical procedures.
2. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
3. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.


## Business Objective -

1. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders.
2. Objective is to identify the risky loan applicants at the time of loan application so that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
3. In other words, to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. And thus minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.


## Conclusions - 
1. Lending club should reduce the high interest loans for 60 months tenure, they are prone to loan  default.
2. Grades are good metric for detecting defaulters. Lending club should examine more information  from borrowers before issuing loans to Low grade (G to A).
3. Lending Club should control their number of loan issues to borrowers who are from CA, FL and  NY to make profits.
4. Small business loans are defaulted more. Lending club should stop/reduce issuing the loans to  them.
5. Borrowers with mortgage home ownership are taking higher loans and defaulting the approved  loans. Lending club should stop giving loans to this category when loan amount requested is more  than 12000.
